NAME
       softhsm2-keyconv - converting from BIND to PKCS#8 key file format

SYNOPSIS
       softhsm2-keyconv --in path --out path [--pin PIN]

DESCRIPTION
       softhsm2-keyconv can convert BIND .private-key files to the PKCS#8 file
       format.	This is so that you can import the PKCS#8 file into libsofthsm
       using the command softhsm2-util.  If you have another file format, then
       openssl probably can help you to convert it into the PKCS#8  file  for‐
       mat.

OPTIONS
       --help, -h Shows the help screen.

       --in path
	      The path to the input file.

       --out path
	      The path to the output file.

       --pin PIN
	      The  PIN	will be used to encrypt the PKCS#8 file.  If not given
	      then the PKCS#8 file will be unencrypted.

       --version, -v
	      Show the version info.

EXAMPLES
       The following command can be used to convert a BIND  .private-key  file
       to a PKCS#8 file:

	      softhsm2-keyconv --in Kexample.com.+007+05474.private \
		     --out rsa.pem
